# Freelance Ledger
#### A lightweight, customizable invoice generator for freelancers and small businesses, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — supports dynamic line items, tax calculation, and PDF export.

## Overview
### Freelance Ledger is a dynamic and responsive Freelance Invoice Generator which allows freelancers to create invoices and download them as PDFs. This entire project was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript. This project provides real-time amount calculations, user-friendly input fields as well as a polished PDF export with text animations showing that the pdf has been generated and some motivational text to enhance the user experience. 

## Problem Statement
Freelancers tend to create their invoices manually using spreadsheets or even third-party software or applications. These methods tend to be slow, prone to errors, or are also not free. Many existing tools:
* Lack in customization.
* Do not give real-time feedback or previews.
*	Some third-party software or applications tend to have watermarks when downloading as a PDF.

This project is a solution to these problems by offering a lightweight, interactive, and fully client-side invoice generator which:
*	Calculating tax and total amount automatically
*	Provides a styled preview of the invoice.
*	Allows downloading the invoice as a high-quality PDF.
*	Requires no sign-up or server — just open the webpage and use it.
